            <p>The author or artist of a manhwa is called a manhwaga (만화가; 漫畵家). They take on the task of creating a comic that fits a
            certain format. Manhwa is read in the same direction as English books, horizontally and from left to right, because
            Korean is normally written and read horizontally. It can also be written and read vertically from right to left, top to
            bottom.[2] Webtoons tend to be structured differently in the way they are meant for scrolling where manga is meant to be
            looked at page by page. Manhwa, unlike their manga counterpart, is often in color when posted on the internet, but in
            black & white when in a printed format.[3]
            
            Manhwa art differs from manga and manhua as well with its distinct features. The bodies of characters are often
            realistically proportioned, while the faces remain unrealistic. Manhwas also often have very detailed clothing on their
            characters as well as intricate backgrounds. Webtoons use vertical scrolling to their advantage to demonstrate movement
            or the passage of time. Manhwa webtoons are also recognized for having simplified dialogue compared to print.[4]
