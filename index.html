        <p>Your Name (Japanese: 君の名は。, Hepburn: Kimi no Na wa) is a 2016 Japanese animated romantic fantasy film produced by CoMix
        Wave Films. It depicts a high school boy in Tokyo and a high school girl in the Japanese countryside who suddenly and
        inexplicably begin to swap bodies. The film was commissioned in 2014, written and directed by Makoto Shinkai. It
        features the voices of Ryunosuke Kamiki and Mone Kamishiraishi, with animation direction by Masashi Ando, character
        design by Masayoshi Tanaka, and its orchestral score and soundtrack composed by Radwimps. A light novel of the same
        name, also written by Shinkai, was published a month prior to the film's premiere.
        
        Your Name premiered at the 2016 Anime Expo in Los Angeles on July 3, 2016, and was theatrically released in Japan on
        August 26, 2016 by Toho, and in the United States on April 7, 2017. The film was critically acclaimed, with praise for
        the animation, music, visuals, and emotional weight. The film grossed over ¥41.44 billion (US$382 million) worldwide,
        breaking numerous box office records, including becoming the third highest-grossing anime film of all time, unadjusted
        for inflation. The film won Best Animated Feature at the 2016 Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards, 49th Sitges
        Film Festival, and as the 71st Mainichi Film Awards, and nominated for Best Animation of the Year at the 40th Japan
        Academy Prize. A live-action American remake by Paramount Pictures is in development.

                An Artistic Visual brilliance.
                Came through a post on FB some hours ago about this anime film named “ Your Name”. That post had some relatable lines
                which triggered my soul right through so i downloaded this film right away and just finished watching it, the laptop is
                in my hands while the credits are getting rolled down and i am all emotional coming straight here to right my emotions
                about this art. Am literally out of the words to explain the emotional feeling am having right now,
            </p>

                The storytelling within "Your Name." , after taking a step back, opened my eyes to the magnificent elegance it portrayed
                to viewers like me. To know that stories like these exist really astound me to this day and helped to spark my interest
                in writing once more. Heck, it even urged me to write a review for it, despite me almost never writing reviews for shows
                or movies, even if they were my favorites/ones I loved.

                I see reviews here trying to describe this movie. A romcom about two teenagers and an interesting ability to swap bodies
                at any time within a week. They both grow to love each other as they live in the other's lives. However, there is
                nothing I could do to replicate or try to explain what I really experienced out of the 6 times I've watched this film.
                The artwork is without a doubt stunning, the prettiest animation I've seen across any.
